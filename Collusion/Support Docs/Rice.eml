On January 5, following a briefing by IC leadership on Russian hacking during
the 2016 Presidential election, President Obama had a brief follow-on
conversation with FBI Director Jim Comey and Deputy Attorney General Sally
Yates in the Oval Office. Vice President Biden and I were also present.

President Obama began the conversation by stressing his continued commitment to
ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the Intelligence and law
enforcement communities "by the book". The President stressed that he is not
asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement 
perspective. He reiterated that our law enforcement team needs to proceed as it
normally would by the book.

From a national security persective, however, President Obama said he wants to
be sure that, as we engage with the incoming team, we are mindful to ascertain
if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to
Russia.

Director Comey affirmed that he is proceeding "by the book" as it relates to
law enforcement. From a national security perspective, Comey said he does have
some concerns that incoming NSA Flynn is speaking frequently with Russian
Ambassador Kislyak. Comey said that could be an issue as it relates to sharing
sensitive information. President Obama asked if Comey was saying that the NSC
should not pass sensitive information related to Russia to Flynn. Comey replied
"potentially." He added that he has no indication thus far that Flynn has 
passed classified information to Kislyak, but he noted that "the level of
communication is unusual."

The President asked Comey to inform him if anything changes in the next few
weeks that should affect how we share classified information with the incoming
team. Comey said that he would.
